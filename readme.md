# HPGL (from Eagle) to GCode Converter

This project is aimed to make a simple converter to Covert HPGL output from Eaglecad to GCode Input for a Drawbot. I want to use this for drawing my Print layout to a Copper-Coated PCB using a Drawbot and a simple Permanent Marker.

## How to use

*Note:* Please replace '/' with '\\' (backslash) on windows systems.

cd to the console dir  
`cd <root>/console`

and then run the console app with input and output:  
`dotnet run ../input.hpgl ../output.gcode`
